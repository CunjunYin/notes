## 3. Continual Improvement Model

### 3.1 Model Overview
- **Application**: Applies to the organization's SVS and all products, services, components, and relationships
- **Flexibility**: Serves as a high-level guide; steps vary in scope and detail
- **Non-linear approach**: Steps can be revisited and re-evaluated as needed
- **Integration**: Can be used alongside other frameworks (Agile, DevOps, Lean)

### 3.2 The Six Steps of Continual Improvement

| Step | Key Question | Activities | Focus |
|------|-------------|-----------|-------|
| **1. What is the vision?** | What are we trying to achieve? | Translate organizational vision and objectives; Create high-level improvement vision | Strategic alignment |
| **2. Where are we now?** | What is our current state? | Baseline assessments; Evaluate user perceptions, competencies, processes, technical capabilities, organizational culture | Current state analysis |
| **3. Where do we want to be?** | What is our target state? | Gap analysis; Set improvement objectives, CSFs, and KPIs | Target setting |
| **4. How do we get there?** | What is our plan? | Create improvement plan combining vision, current/target states, and subject matter expertise | Planning |
| **5. Take action** | How do we execute? | Execute improvement actions (waterfall or Agile approaches); Experimentation and iteration | Implementation |
| **6. Did we get there?** | Did we achieve our goals? | Evaluate against objectives, CSFs, and KPIs; Verify destination reached | Evaluation |

### 3.3 Maintaining Momentum
- **Celebration**: Market and celebrate successes
- **Reinforcement**: Strengthen new methods and approaches
- **Embedding**: Integrate changes into organizational culture and processes

## 4. Key Concepts and Terminology

### 4.1 Critical Success Factor (CSF)
**Definition**: A necessary precondition for the achievement of intended results

### 4.2 Key Performance Indicator (KPI)
**Definition**: An important metric used to evaluate the success in meeting an objective

### 4.3 Assessment Areas (Where are we now?)
- User perception of value received
- People's competencies and skills

- **Agile**: Experimental, iterative approaches with possible direction changes
- **Hybrid**: Combination of approaches based on context

## 6. Tracking and Responsibility

### 6.1 Continual Improvement Register (CIR)
- **Purpose**: Database or structured document to track improvement ideas and projects
- **Implementation**: Multiple CIRs at different levels or a master CIR
- **Idea capture**: During projects, software development, and daily operations

### 6.2 Responsibility Allocation
- **Organization-wide**: Everyone shares responsibility for continual improvement
- **Leadership**: Leaders at highest levels drive and support improvement
- **Suppliers**: External partners contribute to improvement initiatives
- **Individual**: Each person identifies and implements improvements

## 7. Integration with Other Practices

### 7.1 Complementary Frameworks
- **Agile**: Iterative development and improvement
- **DevOps**: Integration of development and operations for continuous delivery
- **Lean**: Elimination of waste and process optimization

### 7.2 Service Value Chain Contribution
