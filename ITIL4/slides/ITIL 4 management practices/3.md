### 1.1 Purpose
**To minimize the negative impact of incidents by restoring normal service operation as quickly as possible**

### 1.2 Key Term: Incident
**Definition**: An unplanned interruption to a service or a reduction in the quality of a service

### 1.3 Key Processes and Guidance
- **Incident Categorization**: Design for different types including:
  - Major incidents
  - Information security incidents
  - Varying impact levels
- **Prioritization**: Resolve higher business impact incidents first
- **Target Resolution Times**: Must be agreed, documented and communicated
- **Linking**: Connect incidents to CIs, changes, problems, known errors and knowledge

### 1.4 Incident Management Tools
Modern tools should provide:
- Automated matching of incidents to related incidents, problems or known errors
- Intelligent analysis of incident data
- Recommendations for future incidents
- Collaboration capabilities for effective teamwork

```

### 1.6 Collaboration in Incident Management
- **Swarming**: Multiple stakeholders work together initially until the right resolver is identified
- **Third-party Support**: Requires aligned support agreements for external components
- **Information Sharing**: Tools should facilitate sharing of symptoms, actions, affected CIs
